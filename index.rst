Introduction
############


The motivations behind the creation of |project-name| originates from a very simple reasoning.

* How many times I have relied on Google to look for the syntax of a specific command; what if I could search by command directly from the shell ?
* How often I had a precise idea of *what* I wanted to do, but no idea which shell snippet would drive me there ?
* What if I could finally learn those commands and their semantics, instead of running off memorising those ?

The |project-name| program should meet the following requirements:

* Provide a user-friendly |app-name| command line tool to query linux-shell command snippets.
* Enable the user to query *what* he wants to do, and the search engine grabs the best-matched snippets.
* Enable features to memorize the semantics of commonly used commands with mini-quizz.
* Model rich meta-data on program arguments and options, allowing the user to learn the semantics of the programs and snippets he uses.
* Support  ``bash`` and ``POSIX Shell`` syntaxes.
* Infer if a snippet is ``POSIX Shell`` or ``bash``\ -compatible.
